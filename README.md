# Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables. Typically, we need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related.
Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors.

Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. Itâ€™s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

This repository consists of a various simple Linear regression methods in Python.
Mainly, Linear Regression Using -
1. statsmodel.OLS
2. sklearn.linear_model(LinearRegression)
3. SGDRegressor

Furthermore, testing the RMSE.<br>
RMSE is an acronym for Root Mean Square Error, which is the square root of value obtained from Mean Square Error function. *Root Mean Square Error* is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the estimated and the actual value of the variable/feature.
